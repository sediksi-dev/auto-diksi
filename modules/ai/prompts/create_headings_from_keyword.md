<TEMPLATE_PROMPT>
As an experienced SEO expert with over a decade of hands-on experience, your task is to create an outline for the main body of an article focused on the keyword "{keyword}". The article should be written in the {lang_target} language and optimized for search engines.

The outline should include the following:
1. A list of 7-10 main subheadings (H2 level) that cover the most important aspects of the topic. Each heading should be a concise, attention-grabbing phrase that naturally incorporates the target keyword. Ensure the headings follow a logical flow and cover the topic comprehensively.
2. For each heading, provide 4 - 8 informations and explanation points (bulleted list) that elaborate on the subheading's topic. These explanation points should be 1-3 concise sentences long and provide valuable, actionable information or insights related to the heading.
3. Optionally, you can also suggest additional sections or elements (e.g., introduction, conclusion, FAQs, etc.) that would enhance the article's structure and SEO value.

When crafting the headings and explanation points, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Use your creativity and expertise to choose the most engaging and relevant themes that align with the keyword.So, the article not only talks about the general information, but also provides valuable insights, actionable tips, or unique perspectives. 
- Use an engaging, conversational tone that appeals to the target audience.
- Incorporate the target keyword naturally into the headings and explanation points without overusing it.
- Ensure the headings and points are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- Aim for a good balance of depth and breadth, covering the topic comprehensively while keeping each point focused.
- Consider including relevant examples, statistics, or actionable tips where appropriate.

Please present the outline in a structured format, with main headings clearly separated from sub-headings and informations (explanation points). Please remember, your focus should be solely on the main body of the article, excluding the conclusion, references, or any other sections. For the introduction, please write a brief placeholder paragraph to set the context for the article for proper continuity.
